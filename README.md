This system allows user to log in and request repairs for computer parts and view the status of a repair. Technicians can sign and update a customer's repair status. When building our system we used Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and MySQL. 

Our database was hosted with Amazon Web Services RDS and our application was deployed through Elastic Beanstalk on Amazon Web Services as well.
